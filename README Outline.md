## The work

For this project, you will be doing work that focuses on social impact.

The prompts are there to help jump-start your ideation process. If you would like to change or combine prompts, that's fine! If you want to find your own idea, even better. **Consult your local instructor for final approval before getting started.**  

Remember to start with a good problem statement!


### Economic Data

If you're interested in a project focused on the economy, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has [several datasets](https://www.bls.gov/data/) ranging from employment to inflation.


## Requirements
For the purposes of a DSI project, you must meet a few technical requirements. They are:
1)  A `README.md` file in your project repo. Note that `README` files are automatically rendered by GitHub when you view a repo. Your README should contain:
    - A problem statement.
    - A succinct formulation of the question your analysis seeks to answer.
    - A table of contents, which should indicate which notebook or scripts a stakeholder should start with, and a link to an **executive summary**.
    - A paragraph description of the data you used, plus your data acquisition, ingestion, and cleaning steps.
    - A short description of software requirements (e.g., `Pandas`, `Scikit-learn`) required by your analysis.

2) Your notebook(s) should be **reproducible** and **error-free**. This means:
    - You should set a random seed at the start of every notebook. This will ensure that the random numbers generated in your notebook will be the same every time.
    - You need to provide a _relative path_ to your data, so that if I clone your repo to my machine I can run everything in your repo without error. (You also provide links to any publicly accessible data.)
    - I should be able to `Restart & Run All` in your notebook(s) and see that the _exact same_ results are reproduced.
    - To check that everything worked properly, you may consider forking your own repo to a different location on your computer and checking that all notebooks can run properly from top to bottom.

3) Bear in mind that the value you provide may come from data ingestion, data cleaning, EDA, and/ or a dashboard, etc. While a model may not be immediately apparent, be creative. *Without us telling you exactly what model to build, how could you build a model to increase performance or generate better insights when answering the problem you are facing?*

**Questions**: Questions should be sent to your local instructor. **Questions should be specific, brief, and formatted.**
> This is a good practice to develop! When contacting a boss or a client, you should make your question as easy as possible to answer. Consider the following two examples:

> Example 1: "Hey, I have a question. I'm writing a blog post about TensorFlow but got stuck. This part was confusing: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/tanh Can you help?"

> Example 2: "The TensorFlow tanh documentation says 'Computes hyperbolic tangent of x element-wise.' What does hyperbolic tangent mean? The link to see more is: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/tanh"

> The first example spends about 20 words before mentioning what is going on. The question "Can you help?" is unspecific. The boss/client is required to go to a link in order to get any information about the problem.

> The second example quickly calls out 'Tensorflow tanh documentation,' the explicit quote that is confusing, the explicit question being asked, and a link for additional context. Both examples attempt to get the boss/client/whomever to explain hyperbolic tangent, but imagine how much more quickly someone could answer the second query than the first.

> A helpful way to consider this: When you ask a question, you are basically asking for a favor. You're asking a person to give their time, their brainpower, and their knowledge to you. Every time you ask them to hunt around for more (i.e. they _have_ to travel to a link to get context or they struggle to understand the question you're asking), you're asking a bigger and bigger favor from them.

### Consulting Project Feedback + Evaluation

Data science is a field in which we apply data to solve real-world problems. Therefore, projects and presentations are means by which we can assess your ability to solve real-world problems in a data-driven manner.

When evaluating projects, there are four areas on which your instructors focus.

2. **Audience: Is your presentation appropriate for the stakeholder?** In answering this question, your instructors want to assess how well you present your results to stakeholders. For example:
  - Did you frame the problem appropriately for the audience?
  - Did you use the appropriate level of technical language for your audience?
  - Did you effectively use your time, or did you encounter an issue such as going significantly beyond or under the allotted time or rushing to conclude the presentation in the allotted time?
  - Did you present effectively, or were there things that detract from the overall presentation such as not speaking loudly enough for the audience or repeating oneself?

3. **Methods: Are your methods appropriate for solving the problem?** In answering this question, your instructors want to assess how well you have applied data science methodology to the problem at hand. For example:
  - Did you make well-reasoned modeling choices, or is there clear evidence that the model is inadequate or improper?
  - Are you able to clearly defend your methodological decisions and results?
  - Did you generalize your results properly, or were your conclusions/inferences improper or fallacious?

4. **Value: Have you provided value to the stakeholder through clear, data-driven recommendations?** In answering this question, your instructors want to assess the value you provide to the stakeholder as a data scientist. For example:
  - Did you answer the problem posed to you?
  - Did you make your recommendations clear, or were the recommendations unclear?
  - Were your recommendations data-driven and based on the results of your work?
